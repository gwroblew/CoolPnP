This is a work in progress. Important files are:

bodyN - subsequent versions of the main body of the feeder, I used the latest one in my machine.

  Switch variables mp and mp2 to generate two interlocking feeders (each 15mm wide by default).

gearN - sprocket for tape advance.

rollN - spool for tape cover.

pullmount - mount for the tape cover pulling motor (with variable height, for interlocking).
